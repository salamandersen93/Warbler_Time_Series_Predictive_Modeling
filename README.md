<b>Time Series Predictive Modeling for Palm, Yellow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler Observations in Chester County, PA</b>

This project leverages Scikit Learn to predict observation counts of three warbler species in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering is performed in the data_cleaning_and_preprocessing notebook, which outputs a csv file to be fed into the model analysis file. K-Nearest Neighbor and Regression models were used to predict weekly county observation counts for each species over the next year. Data was sourced from eBird for dates ranging from 2010-2021 (up until June). 

The predicted output files were used to create a Tableau dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mike.andersen5299/viz/Warbler_Time_Series_Modeling/Warbler_Time_Series?publish=yes
